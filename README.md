# Trivia Project

### About the project 

This project allows users to search for trivia questions using either date, category, or difficulty. It is very distinctive and clear what the user to search according to the filter he/she wants to use. 


### Technologies I Used  

Throughout this project, I heavily used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I implemented AJAX to make the fetch call. This was my first time working with an API, so understanding how jservice worked and how to get the data took some time to learn. I have had experience before in website development, but this project really made me think above and beyond and I was able to use my previous skills as well as skills I researched to implement this project. I also learned a lot about session storage which really helped me in the project.

### What I hope to learn

As stated before, I picked up new skills such as using session storage, learning how to get an API, and using DOM manipulation to display my results. If chosen for this position, I would like to learn how to create an intuitive search, allowing the search to predict results based off what the user entered. I was actually able to display all results similar to what the user entered for categories, but pulling the questions from those particular categories and displaying them on a new page was challenging. As I am a sophomore, I have many skills to learn, and I would love more than anything to learn those skills at Capital One.
